                        <p>Hello there! I'm Quan, a full stack web developer and avid learner. 
                        I am pretty comfortable throughout the <strong> MERN </strong>stack. Outside of MERN, 
                        I have also built projects with <strong> mySQL </strong> and <strong>firebase </strong>.</p>
                        <p>Writing clean code and designing optimal solutions to challenging 
                        problems give me great satisfaction. For me, spending time solving algorithm 
                        puzzles is a total treat. I am very excited to embark on a new journey into software/web development. 
                        In my other life, I hold a PhD degree in biology from the University of Chicago and do research for a living.</p>
